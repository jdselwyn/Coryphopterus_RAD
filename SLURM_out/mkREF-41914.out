Settings for dDocentHPC
#Made in notepad++, use for best viewing

These default settings assume ddRAD, no overlapping 151 bp reads

40		Number of Processors (Auto, 1, 2, 3, ..., n threads) cbirdq=40 normal=20
230G	Maximum Memory (1G,2G,..., 256G)  G=gigabytes

----------trimFQ: Settings for Trimming FASTQ Files---------------------------------------------------------------
146		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkREF only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the length of the Read1 reads.
75		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkBAM only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the minimum frag length you want mapped to the reference.
20		trimmomatic LEADING:<quality> (integer, mkBAM only)				Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
15		trimmomatic TRAILING:<quality> (integer, mkREF only)			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
20		trimmomatic TRAILING:<quality> (integer, mkBAM only)			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
TruSeq3-PE-2.fa	trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<fasta> (0, fasta file name)			Specifies the trimmomatic adapter file to use. entering a 0 (zero) will turn off adapter trimming. Options are: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa, TruSeq3-PE.fa, TruSeq3-SE.fa, TruSeq2-PE.fa, TruSeq2-SE.fa, any other files included with trimmomatic.  Entering a custom path here will break the script. If you want a customized file, you have to put it where the default trimmomatic files are located on your computer.  If you have trouble finding this location, run dDocentHPC trimREF and it will be included in the output.
2		trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<seed mismatches> (integer)			specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed
30		trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<palindrome clip thresh> (integer)		specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment
10		trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<simple clip thresh> (integer)			specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
20		trimmomatic SLIDINGWINDOW:<windowSize> (integer)				specifies the number of bases to average across
20		trimmomatic SLIDINGWINDOW:<windowQuality> (integer)				specifies the average quality required.
0		trimmomatic CROP:<bp to keep> (integer, mkBAM only)    Trim read sequences down to this length. Enter 0 for no cropping
0		trimmomatic HEADCROP:<length> (integer, only Read1 for ezRAD)	The number of bases to remove from the start of the read. 0 for ddRAD, 5 for ezRAD
no		FixStacks (yes,no)   											Demultiplexing with stacks introduces anomolies.  This removes them.

----------mkVCF: Settings for variant calling/ genotyping---------------------------------------------------------
no		freebayes -J --pooled-discrete (yes|no) 						If yes, a pool of individuals is assumed to be the statistical unit of observation. 
no		freebayes -A --cnv-map (filename.bed or no)						If the pools have different numbers of individuals, then you should provide a copy number variation (cnv) *.bed file with the "ploidy" of each pool. the bed file should be in the working directory and formatted as follows: popmap_column_1 ploidy_of_pool.  If that doesn't work, try the basenames of the files in popmap column 1.
2		freebayes -p --ploidy (integer)									Whether pooled or not, if no cnv-map file is provided, then what is the ploidy of the samples? for pools, this number should be the number of individuals * ploidy

0.375	freebayes -F --min-alternate-fraction (decimal 0-1)   			There must be at least 1 individual with this fraction of alt reads to evaluate the position. If your individuals are barcoded, then use 0.2. If your data is pooled, then set based upon ~ 1/(numIndivids * ploidy) and average depth of coverage
20		freebayes -C --min-alternate-count (integer)					Require at least this count of observations supporting an alternate allele within a single individual in order to evaluate the position.  default: 2

30		freebayes -$ --read-snp-limit (integer)							Exclude reads with more than N base mismatches, ignoring gaps with quality >= mismatch-base-quality-threshold. default: ~unbounded
20		freebayes -e --read-indel-limit	(integer)						Exclude reads with more than N separate gaps. default: ~unbounded
no		freebayes -w --hwe-priors-off (no|yes)							Disable estimation of the probability of the combination arising under HWE given the allele frequency as estimated by observation frequency.
no		freebayes -V --binomial-obs-priors-off (no|yes)					Disable incorporation of prior expectations about observations. Uses read placement probability, strand balance probability, and read position (5'-3') probability.
no		freebayes -a --allele-balance-priors-off (no|yes)				Disable use of aggregate probability of observation balance between alleles as a component of the priors.
no		freebayes    --no-partial-observations (no|yes)					Exclude observations which do not fully span the dynamically-determined detection window.  (default, use all observations, dividing partial support across matching haplotypes when generating haplotypes.)
no		freebayes    --report-monomorphic (no|yes)						Report even loci which appear to be monomorphic, and report allconsidered alleles, even those which are not in called genotypes. Loci which do not have any potential alternates have '.' for ALT.
