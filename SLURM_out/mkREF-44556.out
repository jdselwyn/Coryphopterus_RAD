Settings for dDocentHPC
#Made in notepad++, use for best viewing

These default settings assume ddRAD, no overlapping 151 bp reads

230G	Maximum Memory (1G,2G,..., 256G)  G=gigabytes

----------trimFQ: Settings for Trimming FASTQ Files---------------------------------------------------------------
146		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkREF only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the length of the Read1 reads.
75		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkBAM only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the minimum frag length you want mapped to the reference.
20		trimmomatic LEADING:<quality> (integer, mkBAM only)				Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
15		trimmomatic TRAILING:<quality> (integer, mkREF only)			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.

TruSeq3-PE-2.fa	trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<fasta> (0, fasta file name)			Specifies the trimmomatic adapter file to use. entering a 0 (zero) will turn off adapter trimming. Options are: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa, TruSeq3-PE.fa, TruSeq3-SE.fa, TruSeq2-PE.fa, TruSeq2-SE.fa, any other files included with trimmomatic.  Entering a custom path here will break the script. If you want a customized file, you have to put it where the default trimmomatic files are located on your computer.  If you have trouble finding this location, run dDocentHPC trimREF and it will be included in the output.
2		trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<seed mismatches> (integer)			specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed
30		trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<palindrome clip thresh> (integer)		specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment

no		freebayes -A --cnv-map (filename.bed or no)						If the pools have different numbers of individuals, then you should provide a copy number variation (cnv) *.bed file with the "ploidy" of each pool. the bed file should be in the working directory and formatted as follows: popmap_column_1 ploidy_of_pool.  If that doesn't work, try the basenames of the files in popmap column 1.
2		freebayes -p --ploidy (integer)									Whether pooled or not, if no cnv-map file is provided, then what is the ploidy of the samples? for pools, this number should be the number of individuals * ploidy

0.375	freebayes -F --min-alternate-fraction (decimal 0-1)   			There must be at least 1 individual with this fraction of alt reads to evaluate the position. If your individuals are barcoded, then use 0.2. If your data is pooled, then set based upon ~ 1/(numIndivids * ploidy) and average depth of coverage
20		freebayes -C --min-alternate-count (integer)					Require at least this count of observations supporting an alternate allele within a single individual in order to evaluate the position.  default: 2
